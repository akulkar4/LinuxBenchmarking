Introduction:
The goal overall is to understand the system and operating system overheads better. It will help us see whether our estimations of OS running time are correct and if not what particular chunk of the OS we missed that allowed such a thing to happen.

The language used for the implementation is C (and inline assembly) and the compiler used is gcc. Optimization settings are ___
